## Explanation of Files
### MATLAB Scripts
The `Lab_2`, `Lab_3`, `Lab_4`, `Lab_5`, and `Lab_6` folders contain MATLAB scripts for specific tasks, such as:
- **prelab2_1.m**: Calculates Bode plots for various components (capacitor, resistor, inductor).
- **prelab2_2.m**: Analyzes bandwidth and Q-factor for band-pass filters.
- **signals3_eval1.m**: Generates sine waves and their FFT for frequency-domain analysis.
- **signals3_eval2.m**: Similar to `signals3_eval1.m` but for different frequencies and amplitudes.
- **signals3_prelab1.m**: Simulates specific signal processing tasks in Lab 3.
- **signals3_prelab2.m**: Additional analysis tasks for Lab 3.
- **signals3_prelab3.m**: Advanced signal analysis tasks in Lab 3.
- **signals4_prelab1.m**: Simulates specific signal processing tasks in Lab 4.
- **signals4_prelab2.m**: Focuses on advanced prelab analysis for Lab 4.
- **signals5_prelab1.m**: MATLAB script for the prelab task in Lab 5.
- **signals6_prelab1.m**: Simulates specific signal processing tasks in Lab 6.
- **signals6_prelab2.m**: Additional analysis tasks for Lab 6.

### Experiment Data
Each `ALLXXXX` folder contains:
- **`.CSV` Files**: Raw data from oscilloscope channels.
- **`.BMP` Files**: Bitmap images representing waveforms.
- **`.SET` Files**: Settings files for Tektronix oscilloscopes.

### PDFs
- **Lab_Manual.pdf**: Detailed guidelines and instructions for all lab experiments.
- **Signals1.pdf, Signals2.pdf, Signals3.pdf**: Additional theoretical notes for experiments 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

## Tools Required
- MATLAB: To run the `.m` scripts for analysis and visualization.
- Tektronix Oscilloscope: For capturing experimental data.
- Any text editor or IDE for modifying scripts.
- PDF Viewer: To read the lab manual and supporting notes.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/b33zbuzz/Signals_and_Systems_Lab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired lab folder (e.g., `Lab_2` or `Lab_3`).
3. Open MATLAB and run the `.m` scripts for the experiment.
4. Use the `.CSV` and `.BMP` files for analysis and cross-verification of results.
5. Refer to the PDFs for theoretical background and detailed instructions.
